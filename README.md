# USTCreate-REBUILD-Unofficial
This is an Unofficial fork of USTC-XeF2 and miaoning-exe's original USTCreate-REBUILD pack, meant to keep client-server compatibility while providing more flexibility.
__Warning__:The repo is currently unstable and may make breaking change.
## Note
This Modpack use Packwiz([https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)) to build. Build scripts can be found in the build/ folder.
Due to the miss of some mods/datapacks in certain platforms, the modpack may include some mods/datapacks file in their unmodified forms.

The Mod 'Create Ratatouille' has inconsistent version and license between Curseforge and Modrinth, and the version on Modrinth is not compatible with Create 6. Since it is licensed ARR on Curseforge(and Github), whether it can be included in modpacks in binary form is not clear. However, to make the modpack actually usable without extra step, the pack in Github Actions and Release(not yet though) contains the binary form of the mod. As long as the correct version is uploaded to Modrinth, newer Modrinth packs will not have the binary in it.
